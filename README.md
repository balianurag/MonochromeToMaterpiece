MonochromeToMasterpiece: An image colorizer is a deep learning model designed to add color to grayscale images, turning black-and-white photos into vibrant, full-color ones. This process leverages neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to predict the colors that would naturally appear in various parts of an image.
